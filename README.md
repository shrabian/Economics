# Economics

This repository is dedicated to hosting simulations of economic theory as taught by The University of Melbourne economics department. Although it currently only provides a simple labour market model I have plans to expand the repo to include DAD-DAS, Solow-Swan, Game Theory and Consumer Optimisation modelling to name a few (hopefully it doesn't stop there).

I undertook this project as a means to familiarise myself with Python, OOP and working with larger scale projects. Consequently, I'm open to new ideas and advice on how to improve existing code.

Thanks,
Sharan Krishnan
